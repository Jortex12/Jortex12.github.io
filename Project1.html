        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>A Technical Writing project, where I was to describe all the steps necessary to perform the changing of a tire tube on a bicycle.
        These instructions were designed for beginners and those who may not be knowledgable on all the technical terms bicycles may have.
        In order to achieve this, I used a combination of easy to understand instructions and images to help guide readers.</p>
