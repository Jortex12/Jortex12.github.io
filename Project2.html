        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>I was tasked with assembling a desktop PC from the case up. After installing all of the components properly it was
        time to move on to configuring the BIOS settings. Finally once everything was up and running I could perform a few tests
        to make sure it was functional.</p>
